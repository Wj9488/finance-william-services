                            Accounts Receivable represent the

                            Effective management of accounts receivable is an essential 
                            element of sound financial management practice.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <mark>It is very important because:</mark>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            - Too much Credit is costly in terms of investment in, and 
                            maintenance of, accounts receivable.
                            <br/>
                            - Too little Credit could result in the loss of profitable sales.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Granting Credit should increase profits hence maximising shareholder 
                            wealth.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <mark>Industry and Competitive Pressure</mark>: It is difficult for firm to offer
                            credit terms that are less generous than their competitorsâ€™ offerings. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <mark>Finance</mark>: Certain types of firm have raised finance more 
                            cheaply than others. This competitive advantage can be reflected in offering 
                            generous credit to customers who experience greater difficulties in raising 
                            finance. 
                            <br/>

                            <mark>Efficiency</mark>:  Information asymmetry exists between buyer and seller.
                            The buyer does not know the quality of the product delivered until it
                            has been thoroughly inspected. The credit period therefore provides
                            a valuable inspection and verification period.

                            To collect accounts receivable as quickly as possible without 
                            losing sale from high-pressure collection techniques.

                            Three main steps:
                            <br/>
                            - Credit Selection and Standards (Don't offer credit to just anyone.)
                            <br/>
                            - Credit Terms (Lay out the terms of the credit precisely)
                            <br/>
                            - Credit Monitoring (Consistently monitor credits)
